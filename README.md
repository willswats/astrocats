The gameplay is similar to Asteroids with a few additions, this includes; new enemies, as well as aspects from Role-playing games, such as XP and weapon upgrades. The goal of the game is to get to level 5 in as short a time as possible, to gain XP you must destroy asteroids and pick up their points. As you play the game, the difficulty will increase, therefore, it is a good idea to upgrade your weapons by picking up the same ones over and over, the weapons are dropped by the Astrocats (enemies).
