## General Information

The gameplay is similar to Asteroids, however, instead of asteroids, the enemies are astrocats (cats in the form of a spaceship). The astrocats spawn either at the top-left or top-right side of the screen and move horizontally across it. The player must shoot the astrocats, dodge their projectiles, and pick up their weapons and points to achieve a high score.

I built this project for a College assignment and all of the assets were created by me (William Watson).
