## General Information

The gameplay is similar to Asteroids with a few additions, this includes; new enemies, weapons and a weapon upgrade system. Just like in Asteroids, the goal of the game is to get a high score, however, instead of destroying asteroids to get a high score, you must pick up points. As you play the game, the difficulty will increase, therefore, it is a good idea to upgrade your weapons by picking up the same ones over and over, the weapons are dropped by the Astrocats (enemies).
